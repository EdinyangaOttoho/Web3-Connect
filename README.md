# Web3 Connect
A simple webpack-bundled toolkit to help with the integration of @web3modal and @wagmi. Suitable for frontend devs willing to implement wallet connect and smart contract interactions with Vanilla JS/HTML.

## Usage
Reference ./src/connect.js via a script tag in your page. Make sure the corresponding files (120.connect.js, 189.connect.js etc.) are in the same folder with the connect.js file as the case may be.

Check the /examples/ folder for examples that demonstrate the usage of Web3-Connect.
